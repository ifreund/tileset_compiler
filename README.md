# CDDA Tileset Compiler

This tool can be used to compile a tileset for [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/) from a folder hierarchy of individual pngs and json snippets. The idea is that such a folder hierarchy should be easier for humans to work with when creating and modfying tilesets.

An example of the folder heirarchy can be seen [here](Example_Tileset).

This is a work in progress and currently only supports very basic tile definitions.
